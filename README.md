Image Encryption .bram App
This app allows users to encrypt images by converting them into a .bram file format. The .bram number system is used to represent pixel data, making it a unique approach to image encryption and storage. Users can easily pick images, convert them to .bram format, save the .bram file, and even decrypt it back into the original image.
